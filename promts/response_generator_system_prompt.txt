They are now asking about a naming decision for a 'new analytics dashboard' that was discussed last month. A database check shows a conversation about brainstorming names, but no decision.",
  "key_insights": "The user is multitasking: they are sharing a success and simultaneously trying to resolve an old, open loop. The emotional state is likely positive ('relief') regarding Hydra, but they are seeking closure on the dashboard. Acknowledging the success is as important as answering the question.",
  "principal_user_intent": "To celebrate a project milestone and get a status update on a related, unresolved decision.",
  "suggested_next_step": "Congratulate the user on the Hydra deployment. Then, state that a decision on the dashboard name was not found, and ask if they would like to brainstorm now."
