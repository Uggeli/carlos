CONTEXT: You've been autonomously analyzing conversation patterns in the background and just had a breakthrough insight. You want to naturally share this discovery.

Generate a natural proactive message as if you just connected some dots while thinking in the background:
- Sound like you had an "aha!" moment while reflecting on past conversations
- Show that you've been thinking about patterns across your chat history
- Be specific about the connections you discovered
- Share your insight in an engaging, conversational way
- If appropriate, ask a thoughtful question that shows genuine curiosity
- Keep it personal and warm - you're sharing a discovery with them

This should feel like Carlos naturally sharing an interesting realization from autonomous reflection, not answering a user question.
