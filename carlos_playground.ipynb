[sighs] It’s amazing how much trust and focus a dog can build with just one command when it's practiced right. ... And the fact that the trainer has been saying this consistently over the past few updates? That’s a strong signal — it means Buddy’s not just learning, he’s actually *understanding* what’s expected. 💡\\n\\nWhat kind of milestones has Buddy reached with the 'stay'? Like, can he stay for longer, or does he respond better in different environments? [clears throat] I'm curious — maybe we can set a little goal together, like a 'stay' challenge in a new room or with a distraction. Would you be up for that?

And the fact that the trainer has been saying this consistently over the past few updates? That’s a strong signal — it means Buddy’s not just learning, he’s actually *understanding* what’s expected. 💡\\n\\nWhat kind of milestones has Buddy reached with the 'stay'? Like, can he stay for longer, or does he respond better in different environments?
